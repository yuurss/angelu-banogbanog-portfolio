          Hello! Iâ€™m Angelu Banogbanog, a passionate Full-Stack Developer currently
          pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I love creating
          modern and user-friendly web applications using technologies like React,
          Tailwind CSS, PHP, and Node.js. My goal is to design digital experiences
          that are both functional and visually engaging.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-6 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify sm:text-left">
          Beyond coding, I continuously explore innovative tools and workflows to enhance productivity and creativity.
           I also integrate emerging technologies like AI-powered solutions (such as GPT) to support development efficiency,
            streamline ideas, and deliver smarter, more dynamic web experiences.
